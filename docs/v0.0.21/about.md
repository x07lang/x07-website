# About X07

X07 is built for a world where coding agents do most of the coding.

That changes what matters:

- Determinism beats “cleverness”
- Canonical encodings beat “flexibility”
- Machine-readable diagnostics beat “nice error strings”
- Stable boundaries beat ad-hoc conventions

X07 is open-source, with direction guided through:

- clear technical governance,
- strict compatibility policies for pinned specs,
- a small core toolchain and a larger ecosystem of packages.

## What X07 is *not*

- A sandbox for running hostile, untrusted code.
- A language that optimizes primarily for human hand-writing.
- A language that allows unlimited “styles” for the same task.

## What X07 is

- A deterministic substrate for autonomous repair loops.
- A practical C-backend systems language.
- A library ecosystem designed around pinned contracts.
