# Official builds

An official X07 build is an artifact that:

- Is produced from an official release tag in `x07lang/x07`.
- Matches the published release manifest (when present).
- Is signed by the X07 release keys (when signing is enabled).

If a build does not meet these requirements, it must not be presented as an official build.
