# Versioning

## Toolchain

The toolchain (`x07`, `x07c`) uses SemVer.

## Stdlib packages

Stdlib packages are versioned independently and pinned by `stdlib.lock`.

## Schemas/contracts

Schema files under `spec/` are versioned by their `schema_version` identifiers and updated when contracts change.
